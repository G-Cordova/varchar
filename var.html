			<h2>What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>CHAR is faster, VARCHAR is more flexible</li>
					<li>CHAR has the potential to waste bytes if all charactors are not utilized, where as with VARCHAR, no bytes are wasted because a (nul) is counted as the last stop byte</li>
					<li>CHAR ≤ 255 and VARCHAR ≤ 65535</li>
					<li>Expanded VARCHAR's do not index well</li>
